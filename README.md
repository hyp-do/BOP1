# BOP1
Second WGU C# Project. This was an appointment tracking application created with WinForms. Key take aways were working with databases, verification, and validation. 

## Introduction

Throughout your career in software design and development, you will be asked to create applications with various features and criteria based on a variety of business requirements. For this assessment, you will create your own C# application with requirements that mirror those you will encounter in a real-world job assignment.
The skills you will showcase in this assessment are also directly relevant to technical interview questions for future employment. This application should become a portfolio piece for you to show to future employers.

(Note the database for this application was provided by WGU and hosted by uCertify and may no longer be accessible or exist, since the database was assigned per student). 

## Scenario

You are working for a software company that has been contracted to develop a scheduling desktop user interface application. The contract is with a global consulting organization that conducts business in multiple languages and has main offices in Phoenix, Arizona; New York, New York; and Lond, England. The consult organization has provided a MySQL database that your application must pull data from. The database is used for other systems and there its structure cannot be modified. 
The organization outlined specific business requirements that must be included as part of the application. From these requirements, a system analyst at your company created solution statements for you to implement in developing the application. These statements are listed in the requirements section.

## Requirements

A.	Create a log-in form that can determine the user’s location and translate login and error control messages (e.g., “The username and password did not match.”) into the user’s language and in one additional language

B.	Provide the ability to add, update, and delete customer records in the database, including name, address, and phone number.


C.	Provide the ability to add, update, and delete appointments, capturing the type of appointment and a link to the specific customer record in the database.

D.	Provide the ability to view the calendar by month and by week.

E.	Provide the ability to automatically adjust the appointment times based on user time zones and daylight-saving time.

F.	 Write exception controls to prevent each of the following. You may use the same mechanism of exception control more than once, but you must incorporate at least two different customized mechanisms of exception control.

-	Scheduling an appointment outside business hours
-	Scheduling overlapping appointments
-	Entering nonexistent or invalid customer data
-	Entering an incorrect username and password

G.	Write two or more lambda expressions to make your program more efficient, justifying the use of each lambda expression with an in-line comment.

H.	Write code to provide reminders and alerts 15 minutes in advance of an appointment, based on the user’s log-in.

I.	Provide the ability to generate each of the following reports using the collection classes:

-	Number of appointment types by month
-	The schedule for each consultant
-	One additional report of your choice

J.	Provide the ability to track user activity by recording timestamps for user log-ins in a .txt file, using the collection classes. Each new record should be appended to the log file, if the file already exists. 

K.	Demonstrate professional communication in the content and presentation of your submission.
